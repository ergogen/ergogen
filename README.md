The project aims to provide a common configuration format to describe ***ergonomic*** 2D layouts and generate automatic plates, cases, as well as un-routed PCBs for them. The project grew out of (and is an integral part of) the [Absolem keyboard], and shares its [Discord] server as well.

## Getting Started

**NOTE:** Ergogen v4 makes a few breaking changes to the format. This makes the documentation for Ergogen and many examples available on the net somewhat obsolete. Rest assured that a complete documentation rewrite is underway to address this (preview at https://deploy-preview-12--ergogen.netlify.app/ , but it's mostly just for preprocessing and points for now). Until this matures, your best bet is relying on the community-driven migration guide ( https://github.com/tsteffek/Ergogen-V4-Migration-Guide ). Also, I hear there'll soon be a series of blog posts detailing the creation process of a complete keyboard using ergogen v4, so stay tuned for that as well. Also also, joining our Discord can get you many helpful answers in the meantime, should you get stuck ( http://discord.ergogen.xyz ).


Until there's a proper "Getting started" guide, try getting acquainted with **Ergogen** by following these steps in order:

<br>

1. Read the **[Documentation]**.
    
    D'uuh.
    They're not complete by any measure, but should give you a fairly good idea what you're dealing with here.

    <br>
    
2. Try one of the web-based deployments.

    [![Button Unofficial]][Unofficial]
   
    The unofficial deployment is probably better, tbh, and will soon be replacing the official one.
    Choose either one, then click things, look at outputs and see if things start to make sense.
   
    There is no need for you to download the **CLI** unless you want to do one of the following:
   
    - Preview in-development features
    - Use custom modifications
    - Contribute code
   
    <br>

3. Search the [`ergogen`][Topic] topic on GitHub.

    There, you can look at (and reverse engineer) a variety of real life configs using **Ergogen**.
    Pop them into the web UI to see what they do, tinker with them and things should start to make more sense.

    <br>

4. If a question persists after all of the above, feel free to ask it over on **[Discord]** and we'll do our best to help you out.
